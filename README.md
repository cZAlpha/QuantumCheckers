# QuantumCheckers
### Made in cooperation with Delaware State University, under the supervision of Dr. Ren. 
### Credit to Qiskit for their quantum computing application that was used as a basis for this game.
### Credit to the creator of the Pygame Python library, their library was used as the engine for this game.

## Our Goal:
Our goal is to make an interactive game geared towards high schoolers in order to help them learn more about quantum computing and its applications.

## Our Game:
Our game, called "Quantum Checkers" (name is subject to change) is a game where you manipulate qubits in order to mimic a pattern created by the specific use of certain quantum gates on the aforementioned qubits.

## Our Team:
Our team consists of three sub-teams: Supervisors, Backend Developers, and Frontend Developers.
#### Our Supervisor: Lianxin Xin
#### Our Backend Developers: Amin Boukari, Huixiang Zhang
#### Our Frontend Developers: Noah Klaus, London Anderson
